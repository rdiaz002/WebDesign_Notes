Tim was also the inventor of the first web page editor/browser called the WorldWideWeb.app along with the first ever server, httpd.

The first webpage was available on the open internet by the end of 1990. The people involved with CERN were invited to join the new web community. 

Tim understood that his invention would have more potention if it was available to the public with out any fees or asking for permission to use it. He quotes 

>"Had the technology been proprietary, and in my total control, it would probably not have taken off. You canâ€™t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it."

In April of 1993 the web was made free for anyone. This sparked a wave of creativity and innovation.

In 1994 Tim join MIT and became the founder of W3C(World Wide Web Consortium). W3C is responsible for creatings open web standards.

# Testing 

There are three kinds of tests 

1. Unit Tests : Tests components that have no connection to other components. Example would be testing a function that takes 2 strings and checks if they are the same. (Have a large amount of these )

2. Integration Tests : Tests a group of individual units. The purpose is to expose faults in the interaction between units. (Have a medium amount of these )

3. Acceptance Tests E2E: Tests the overall system as a whole. Checks if the system is compliant. (Have a few of these)

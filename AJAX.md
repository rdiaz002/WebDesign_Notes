# AJAX

What is AJAX?
Asynchronous Javascript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web serve behind the scenes. This means it is possible to update parts of a web page without reloading the whole page. It works in the background.

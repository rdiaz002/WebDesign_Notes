# Git

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 

To start a Git repo you create a new directory and call git init within that directory. 

To attach that directory to a remote repo you can use git remote add < git url>. This will allow you to push changes and all your files to the remote repo. 

To update your git with a remote repo. you use git pull or git fetch. This will update your branch until its latest commit. 

To commit changes to a repo you use git add . first to add all the changes files. Then you use git commit -m "message" to write a commit. Then you use git push to push your commit to the remote repo.

To check the status of your git repo you type git status. To get a log of all the commits you use git log. 

TO change branches you use git checkout < branch >. 

To create a new branch you use git branch < branch name >
